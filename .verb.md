## Usage

The main export is a constructor function that is used to create new `Question` objects, which are used in prompts by [base-prompt][].

```js
var Question = require('{%= name %}');
var question = new Question('color', 'What is favorite color?');
```

**Examples**

Any of the following signatures may be used:

```js
var question = new Question('color'); // sets message as the same value as `name`
var question = new Question('color', 'What is favorite color?');
var question = new Question('color', {message: 'What is favorite color?'});
var question = new Question({name: 'color', message: 'What is favorite color?'});
var question = new Question({name: 'color'});
```
