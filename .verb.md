## Usage

The main export is a constructor function that is used to create new `Question` objects, which are used in prompts by [enquirer][].

```js
var Question = require('{%= name %}');
var question = new Question('name', 'Aren\'t you a little short for a stormtrooper?');
```

**Examples**

In addition to the above example, any of the following signatures may be used:

```js
var question = new Question('name');
var question = new Question('name', {message: 'Aren\'t you a little short for a stormtrooper?'});
var question = new Question({name: 'name', message: 'Aren\'t you a little short for a stormtrooper?'});
var question = new Question({name: 'name'});
```
